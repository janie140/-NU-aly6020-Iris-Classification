# NU-aly6020-Iris-Classification

Introduction

This project explores and classifies iris flowers based on their attributes in the “Iris dataset” by implementing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model. The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, with labels of 0,1, and 2.
